## What tasks did I work on?
I did a comparison of Unity, Greenfoot and Torque3d and came to the conclusion that Greenfoot suits our objective and team the best.
## What am I Planning to work next?
To get a basic game ready for example, so that I get a hands on approach for the development. And use that approach to set up the starter screen for the avengers game. 
## Blockers
Currently there are no blockers from my side.

I will start working on the character select screen and also embed audio in the screen so that it runs in the background while selecting a character.
## Blockers
I had a doubt about the number of characters and the characters that will be available in the game?
